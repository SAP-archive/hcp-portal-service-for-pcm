## 2. Configure Your Account

### 2.1 	Deploy PCM artifacts
 1. Navigate to	[ https://github.com/SAP/hcp-portal-service-for-pcm/releases](https://github.com/SAP/hcp-portal-service-for-pcm/releases)
 2. Prepare content for deployment. There are two options:  
     a. Download ZIP files from the Releases folder.  
     b. Clone and Create a Zip file:  
         1.  	Clone the repository to your computer, or download it as a ZIP file by clicking the Clone or download button and selecting Download ZIP, and extract its contents.  
         2. 	Archive every folder content to ZIP files (pcmapps, pcmcpapps, pcmsitetemplate).

 3. Import the following ZIP files to your SCP account:
    * pcmapps.zip	(Business applications)
    * pcmcpapps.zip	(Invitation application)
    * pcmsitetemplate.zip	(Site template).

   You can import the files to SAP Web IDE and then deploy them to SCP, or you can directly deploy them to SCP through the SCP cockpit (Applications >>HTML5 Applications >> Import from File.  
   If the applications were deployed through SCP cockpit, they should be activated by clicking the link in the app's name, clicking on 'Versioning' in the left menu, 'Versions' under History section, and then on the activation icon in the 'Actions' column.  
 4. (Optional, if you imported the pcm applications via SAP Web IDE)
 	Preview your site template in SAP WEB-IDE:
	a. Open SAP Web IDE and right click on the 'pcmsitetemplates project'.  
	b. Choose Run -> Run as -> Preview Site Template.  


### 2.2 Create PCM roles
   1. Open the SAP SCP account cockpit and navigate to Services >> Portal Service >> Configure Portal Service >> Roles.
   2. Create the following new roles:
       * PartnerManager
       * PartnerContact
       * Applicant
       * Candidate


###  2.3 Create an email template in SCI
   The email template for the PCM invitation flow includes a SAP logo as well as pre-defined text. You may update the email template used by the SCI to send invitations to users according to your needs.
   
   1.	Download SAPID Mail Templates.zip from [ https://github.com/SAP/hcp-portal-service-for-pcm/releases](https://github.com/SAP/hcp-portal-service-for-pcm/releases)
   2.	Adjust the template according to your needs.
   3.  Add the template to the SCI IDP account. For more details:  https://help.sap.com/viewer/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/Cloud/en-US/3c4f39763f3c4d659a43e1c33c94b95e.html
   4.	Define the uploaded mail template to your application. For more details:       https://help.sap.com/viewer/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/Cloud/en-US/bb2c79b71f8d47ec877882d78e0ceb39.html

#### 2.3.1 Set up Privacy policy in SCI
To adhere to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), after an 
invitee has accepted the mail invitation (by pressing the account activation button), as part of the activation process users should read a privacy policy document and consent to it.
For this purpose you as the Partner Manager should configure the privacy policy document in SCI as follows:
   1. Create a privacy policy document and add it to SCI. For more details:
 https://help.sap.com/viewer/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/Cloud/en-US/e73cf2dc28fa40c09dd4ad294c23ee5f.html
   2. Define the privacy policy for your application. For more details:
 https://help.sap.com/viewer/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/Cloud/en-US/96111183bf734776bfbec21f3d5f5a5a.html 

Please note that if you have defined a new privacy policy document for your application, all users that have already consented to the old privacy policy will now have to consent to the new updated policy on login to the application.


### 2.4	Set up a trust between the customer account and SCI (for log-on scenario)

Note! If the trust was done as part of the [onboarding guide](https://uacp2.hana.ondemand.com/viewer/462e41a242984577acc28eae130855ad/Cloud/en-US), the below step should be skipped.

#### 2.8	Configure SAP C4C Backend

##### 2.8.1	Purpose
This section describes how to create a Callback from the CRM that is used in the PCM scenario, to the Portal Service account.

The configuration is mandatory for enabling the entire self-registration scenario, including the transition between roles: Applicant -> Candidate -> Partner Manager.

Note that the Callback is configured on the CRM per SCP system, which means that only one SCP account can be configured.


##### 2.8.2	Instructions

   2.	Click the Administration tab and choose General Settings.
   3.	Click on Communication Systems under the 'Integration' section.
   4.	Create a new system with the following details:
            1. ID = PCM_PORTAL
            2. Host Name = [portal java application's name: cloudnwcportal or cloudsandboxportal]-[SCP account name].[data center, E.g. eu1, us1].hana.ondemand.com/, E.g. cloudnwcportal-aab4aef77.eu1.hana.ondemand.com/
            3. System Access Type = Internet
   5. Save the settings.
   6. Set Actions to Active.
   7. Click on Communication Arrangement.
   8. Click on New, and then do the following:
      1. Select Scenario: Choose the Channel Partner Registration Portal Callback option and click Next.
      2. Define Business Data: Choose the communication system you created in step 4, and click Next.
      3. Define Technical Data:
         1. Communication Method = Direct Connection.
         2. Application Protocol = Http.
         3. Authentication Method = User ID and Password.
         4. Click the Edit Credentials button and set the details (email address) of the TENANT_ADMIN user you have on SCP for the User ID (the user can be found in SCP - Services - Portal Service - Configure Portal Service - Roles). Please note that if, for some reason, the TENANT_ADMIN user is locked, the callback will fail.
      4. Review: Review and verify the accuracy of the data you filled in, then click on Finish and then Confirm
   9.	In the Communication Arrangement, click the entry of the new arrangement, then click Edit.
   10.	Switch to the Technical Data tab.
   11.	Click the Edit Advanced Settings button.
   12.	Make sure that the port is 443 and in the Path field add: portal/v1/services/invitations/continue_flow/
   13.	Click Save.

## 3. Create & Configure the PCM Site
1.	In the SCP cockpit, go to Services – Portal Service, and from there click on Go to Service. This opens the Site Directory of your portal service.
2.	Go to 'Site Directory' from the left menu and click on “+” to create a new site. Select the Partner Portal site template and click Create.
3.	(Optional) Set site alias:
    + Go to site settings.
    + Click Edit and set site alias.
    + Click Save.
4. Data Retention Policy:
The personal contact details of all invitees who ignore the invitation, or do not accept the privacy terms in the registration form, will be deleted from the contacts table after the number of retention days that are specified in the site’s settings.

 **How to specify the number of retention days?**
   + Go to Site Settings.
   + Click Edit.
   + Under Custom Site Properties, set the key "data_retention_days" with an integer value that represents the number of days.
   + Click Save.

**Note:** If the number of retention days is not specified, all personal contact details of pending invitees will be deleted after 90 days (default).

5.	Publish the site by clicking on the Publish button in the site header. This makes the site available for all users.
6.	The URL of the published site will be used later on for the registration of new applicants and future actions. 
7.	There are two URLs related to your site:  
 **I.** Public URL to start the registration flow:
https://flpnwc-[account name].dispatcher.[data center].hana.ondemand.com/sites/[site alias]#Home-show
**II.** Authenticated URL. Data from C4C is available for Partner Managers:
https://flpnwc-[account name].dispatcher.[data center].hana.ondemand.com/sites/[site alias]?hc_login#Shell-home
  
**Note:** Please do not assign users directly to Partner Manager role in SCP . The assignment to this role is done automatically by the callback batch job in C4C, which runs every night in the background, after the user's application form is approved.
